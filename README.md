# MOOC machine learning study

As a trainee at the [Information Processing Group](https://ipg.epfl.ch/) at EPFL, I studied to what extent one can predict a MOOC userâ€™s success based on how the user interacts with the MOOC platform during the first ten days of the course. This IPython Notebook is the product of this project, with documentation of the research process and details on the findings.
